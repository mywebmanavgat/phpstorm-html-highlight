Colour the tags according to yourself with the better highlight plugin for phpstorm.


Phpstorm is a great programme for Php developers. However, while this programme has very superior capabilities on the Php side, it does not meet some very simple things.

While this colouring may be confusing for some people, the main things that a full stack developer should edit and be interested in on the frontend side are the following tags. 
form,input,table,a,button these tags send requests to the backend or list the data received from the backend. So a developer wants to be able to find them quickly while browsing view files. 

I did a lot of research and some users said that this feature was in dreamveawer 13 years ago and php storm should have it. But phpstorm developers did not care about this.

With the Better Highlight plugin, I found that I can make custom colouring by typing regex. However, you need to buy the paid version of the plugin to use regex. 

In this repo I leave the necessary regex commands for colouring groups. There may be missing attributes, if you send an update it will be published.
